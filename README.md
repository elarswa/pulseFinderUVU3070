# pulseFinderUVU3070
exercise in using <algorithms> and lambda functions to process a data set and find pulses

make using "make"
see make file for other compile/run options

run using <executable> <ini file>

will process all .dat files in a directory, identifying pulses in the data and identifying if the start of a pulse is piggybacking on the start of another pulse
running in valgrind shows there are still memory errors  but I don't plan on coming back to this
